This may be the only, maybe all due respect, that we don't post these amendments, these documents. And I just think we should. I think it's public information and I just think nothing could be more important than a $10 billion budget from a policy standpoint and everything contained in it.

The posting of the amendments received by committees or when they're put on in the committee is the role of the committee secretary and committee staff. But from the council service, we do provide committee secretaries with PDFs of any proposed amendment or substitute that's going to be before a committee. And the only exception is that our duty of confidentiality does flow directly to you as legislators. And so if you were to tell us not to distribute that amendment, we do follow your direction on that. But that is the common practice to deliver the PDFs to the committee secretary.\n",

The sponsor could give them to whoever they wanted if they want to share the amendment. If you don't want to share the amendment, that's a legislator's prerogative.

If you want us to draft an amendment, amend the bill entirely. We'd have to get the amendment drafted in the bill and then bring the bill back down and then know where the amendments are, which could be a one or two day process, depending on how big the bill is.\n",
