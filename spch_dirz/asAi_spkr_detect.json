[{"Speaker A": "We don't have the capability of a scanner, so you can't scan and put the amendment up if you send it to us a day before. I don't even know if there's a scanner in the building. I think there may be one downstairs in the clerk's office. And so putting stuff electronically up amendments is something New Mexico has fallen behind with technology driven access."},
 {"Speaker B": "Well, Mr. Chair, I think it's actually a rule now. We've passed a law, maybe even said, Representative McQueen, saying that all amendments would actually have to be posted online. This may be the only, maybe all due respect, that we don't post these amendments, these documents. And I just think we should. I think it's public information and I just think nothing could be more important than a $10 billion budget from a policy standpoint and everything contained in it. So I think, Shawn, I mean, with all the other committees and legislature amendments because of that rule, what is the common practice of things being put online and how timely are those really?"},
 {"Speaker C": "Mr. Chair, Senator, you're correct. The joint rule was passed a year or so ago. Last year was the first year of implementation. The posting of the amendments received by committees or when they're put on in the committee is the role of the committee secretary and committee staff. But from the council service, we do provide committee secretaries with PDFs of any proposed amendment or substitute that's going to be before a committee. And the only exception is that our duty of confidentiality does flow directly to you as legislators. And so if you were to tell us not to distribute that amendment, we do follow your direction on that. But that is the common practice to deliver the PDFs to the committee secretary."},
 {"Speaker B": "And then they get put online while they're being discussed."},
 {"Speaker C": "Mr. Chair, in the, in the Senate, that has been the practice last year."},
 {"Speaker A": "Okay. And we've done that as soon as they're adopted. But we can't put the amendment on because we don't know if it's going to pass or not. So the amendment in the PDF is not put online. Ling just told me, until the amendment passes, because we don't know what it does. I mean, we have copies of the amendments. The sponsor could give them to whoever they wanted if they want to share the amendment. If you don't want to share the amendment, that's a legislator's prerogative. But they're not put up there for discussion purposes because the bill hasn't been amended. And so until they're amended, the amendment's not on there. And then if you want to amend the bill. If you want us to draft an amendment, amend the bill entirely. We'd have to get the amendment drafted in the bill and then bring the bill back down and then know where the amendments are, which could be a one or two day process, depending on how big the bill is."},
 {"Speaker B": "Anyway, Mr. Chair, to the extent possible, I just personally like putting it out there ahead of time, including putting it online, which probably can be done just as well as after the fact. And so just like a bill we vote on that hasn't been adopted. But anyway, I'll just. That's how I feel about it, you know, Mr. Chair, and the same usual deal. So appreciate the discussion. Thank you."},
 {"Speaker A": "We all have text messaging, so the lobbyists can text us if they like the amendments or not."},
 {"Speaker B": "Sure."},
 {"Speaker A": "Probably had some play in the amendment process. Anyway, Senator Gonzalez, thank you."},
 {"Speaker B": "And we also have to take the advice from counsel because sometimes he turns into a substitute."},
 {"Speaker A": "Any other questions? We're going to be as transparent as we can, but you know, we get moving in certain times and it's just we can't. I can't manage every little detail. So you're here to talk to us about bills and."},
 {"Speaker C": "thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes."},
 {"Speaker A": "You're gonna sing the old song."},
 {"Speaker C": "So I was requested, Mr. Chair."},
 {"Speaker A": "Oh, wait now, Senator Gonzalez, we're gonna need to go into executive. Now you want to make a motion, Mr."},
 {"Speaker C": "Chair? Some move that we go into executive session."},
 {"Speaker A": "Second Senator Shindo, any objection to going to executive. No, we're not talking about personnel, we're going to talk about bills."},
 {"Speaker C": "It."}]
