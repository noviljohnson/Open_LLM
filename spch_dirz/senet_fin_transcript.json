This may be the only,  maybe I'll do respect that we don't post these amendments,  these documents, and I just think we should.  I think it's public information,  and I just think nothing can be more important.  A $10 billion budget from a policy standpoint  and everything contained in it.  So I think, Shana, I mean, with all the other committees  and legislature amendments, because of that rule,  what is the common practice of things being put online  and uptime, how timely are those, really?"

The posting of the amendments received by committees  or when they're put on in the committee  is the role of the committee secretary and committee staff,  but from the council service,  we do provide committee secretaries with PDFs  of any proposed amendment or substitute  that's going to be before a committee.  And the only exception is that our duty of confidentiality  does flow directly to you as legislators,  and so if you were to tell us not to distribute that amendment,  we do follow your direction on that,  but that is the common practice  to deliver the PDFs to the committee secretary."

So the amendment in the PDF is not put online,  the thing just told me until the amendment passes  because we don't know what it does.  I mean, we have copies of the amendments,  the sponsor could give them to whoever they wanted  if they want to share the amendment.  If you don't want to share the amendment,  that's a legislature's prerogative.  But they're not put up there for discussion purposes  because the bill hasn't been amended.  And so until they're amended, the amendment's on there.  And then if you want to amend the bill,  if he wants to draft an amendment,  the amendment bill entirely,  we'd have to get the amendment drafted in the bill  and then bring the bill back down  and then know where the amendments are,  which could be a one or two day process  to paying the how big the bill is."
