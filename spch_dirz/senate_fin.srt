1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,784
We don't have the capability of a scanner, so you can't scan and

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:07,128
put the amendment up if you send it to us a day before.

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:09,432
I don't even know if there's a scanner in the building. I think there may

4
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:11,780
be one downstairs in the clerk's office.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,600
And so putting stuff electronically

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,392
up amendments is something New Mexico has

7
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,480
fallen behind with technology driven access.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,300
Well, Mr. Chair, I think it's actually a rule now. We've passed a law,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,044
maybe even said, Representative McQueen, saying that all amendments would actually have to

10
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:36,532
be posted online. This may be the only, maybe all

11
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:40,200
due respect, that we don't post these amendments, these documents.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,660
And I just think we should. I think it's public information

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,644
and I just think nothing could be more important than a $10 billion budget

14
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:52,164
from a policy standpoint and everything contained in it. So I

15
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:56,164
think, Shawn, I mean, with all the other committees and legislature amendments

16
00:00:56,212 --> 00:01:00,060
because of that rule, what is the common practice of things being put

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,180
online and how

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,680
timely are those really?

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,676
Mr. Chair, Senator, you're correct. The joint rule

20
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,892
was passed a year or so ago. Last year was

21
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,560
the first year of implementation.

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,452
The posting of the amendments received by committees or when they're put

23
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:24,572
on in the committee is the role of the committee secretary and

24
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:28,376
committee staff. But from the council service, we do provide

25
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:32,856
committee secretaries with PDFs of any proposed amendment or substitute

26
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,440
that's going to be before a committee. And the only exception is

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,152
that our duty of confidentiality does flow

28
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:44,120
directly to you as legislators. And so if you were to tell us not

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,736
to distribute that amendment, we do follow your direction

30
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:51,576
on that. But that is the common practice to deliver the PDFs

31
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:56,260
to the committee secretary. And then they get put online while they're being discussed.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,768
Mr. Chair, in the, in the Senate, that has been the practice last year.

33
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:04,112
Okay. And we've done that as soon as they're adopted.

34
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:07,072
But we can't put the amendment on because we don't know if it's going to

35
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:10,800
pass or not. So the amendment in the PDF is not put online.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,800
Ling just told me, until the amendment passes, because we don't know what

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,426
it does. I mean, we have copies of the amendments. The sponsor

38
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,482
could give them to whoever they wanted if they want to share the amendment.

39
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:24,910
If you don't want to share the amendment, that's a legislator's prerogative.

40
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,874
But they're not put up there for discussion purposes because the

41
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,630
bill hasn't been amended. And so until they're amended,

42
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,866
the amendment's not on there. And then if you want to amend the bill.

43
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:40,442
If you want us to draft an amendment, amend the bill entirely.

44
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:43,750
We'd have to get the amendment drafted in the bill

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,652
and then bring the bill back down and then know where

46
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:50,676
the amendments are, which could be a one or two day process,

47
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,640
depending on how big the bill is.

48
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,972
Anyway, Mr. Chair, to the extent possible, I just personally

49
00:02:58,036 --> 00:03:00,996
like putting it out there ahead of time,

50
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:04,372
including putting it online, which probably can be done just

51
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:07,700
as well as after the fact. And so

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,882
just like a bill we vote on that hasn't been adopted. But anyway,

53
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:14,650
I'll just. That's how I feel about it, you know, Mr. Chair, and the same

54
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,706
usual deal. So appreciate the discussion. Thank you.

55
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:21,002
We all have text messaging, so the lobbyists can text us if

56
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:24,586
they like the amendments or not. Sure. Probably had some play in the amendment process.

57
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,290
Anyway, Senator Gonzalez, thank you.

58
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,338
And we also have to take the advice from counsel

59
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:33,870
because sometimes he turns into a substitute.

60
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,542
Any other questions? We're going to be as transparent as we

61
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:46,238
can, but you know, we get moving in

62
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:49,646
certain times and it's just

63
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:52,490
we can't. I can't manage every little detail.

64
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,070
So you're here to talk to us about

65
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,182
bills and. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes. You're gonna

66
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,530
sing the old song.

67
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,228
So I was requested, Mr. Chair. Oh, wait now, Senator Gonzalez,

68
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:12,684
we're gonna need to go into executive. Now you want to make a

69
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:16,640
motion, Mr. Chair? Some move that we go into executive session.

70
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,480
Second Senator Shindo, any objection to going to executive.

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,116
No, we're not talking about personnel, we're going to talk about bills.
